Oh, life is bigger 
It's bigger than you and you are not me 
The lengths that I will go to the distance in your eyes 
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

Every whisper of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

First line

Second line
